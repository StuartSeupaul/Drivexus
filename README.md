# Drivexus

#### Drivexus is a platform created specifically to streamline and enhance the operations of
#### driving schools. Students are able to create an account which enables them to
#### book appointments with driving instructors in the closest proximity. In addition, they
#### can access prepwork such as multiple choice tests(created by an admin), as well as
#### practice real life driving scenarios through 2D simulations. The following technologies
#### were used in the architecture of this platform: Ruby on Rails, Javascript, JQuery, Phaser,
#### HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
